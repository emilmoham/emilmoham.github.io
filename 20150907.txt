<h4>Yeah This Will Proabably Do</h4>

<p>Gray, gray and more gray.  A nice gray background with a slighly darker gray enclosing each element, and of course gray text with a hint of blue to give the site some color. Of course the fonts are all set to Arial or default by the Normalize css sheet, I wouldn't want anyone to here and have their brain explode due to all the customization I put in. It's not the best looking thing I've ever made, but fuck, it's at least it's something I can put online. Despite how bland it is, I actually kind of like the design, it's boring but clean. I probably won't leave it like this, I'll at least change the font at some point or add a logo somewhere. The good thing is that no one has to see this. This is my website, in all its plain glory. By the time people see it I may have entirely changed the look.<br/></p>
<p>As for what I want to do with the site, I'm not quite sure yet. I've been playing around wiht the idea of creating my own blog and website for well over two years now. It would be great to have somewhere online that I could host some of my projects, but I really just want a place where I can quickly dump my thoughts. The nice thing about a blog in this style is  I'll be able mentally vomit here in a relatively organized way. I already have a few ideas of what my first few blogs can be about, but I have no idea when I'll get around to writing those up. I don't want to give myself a regular schedule to update the site because, knowing myself, there would be far too many low quality, boring posts in between the ones that actually have some sort of content or interest to them. I'd much rather just update the blog whenever I have something to actually write about. Additionally, my writing, at least in my opinion, is really ass. It get's me by in school, but it's nowhere near a point where I'd like it to be. Now that I have this blog I finally have a place where I can practice and sharpen my writing skills.<br/></p>
<p>It's been quite a while since I actually went through with one of my project ideas and I hope this is the first in a long string of projects I actually manage to pull off. I have no idea what I'll actually accomplish with this but it's nice to have another tool in my aresenal.</p>
