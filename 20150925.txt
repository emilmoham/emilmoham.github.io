<h4>Life is Strange: Episode 2</h4>
<h5>September 25th, 2015</h5><br/>
<p>It's that time of the week again. I've just had the oppuortunity to play through Episode 2 of Life is Strange once again and now I'm ready to write down my thoughts about the episode while they're fresh in my head. Looking back over my write up for Epsiode 1, I wasn't too happy with how I organized and explained my thoughts. This time around I want to focus on the things that really stuck out about this epsisode that I really liked.<br/></p>
<p>Episode 2 is my second favorite episode in the series so far. This is the episode that really snagged my attention and convinced me to buy it at the start of summer. Up until this point I had been watching the game through the "Let's Play" of Jon from ManyATrueNerd. As I watched him progress through the episode, I realized that there was more to this game than I had originally thought. I had watched his playthrough of Episode 1 and been rather unimpressed. The gameplay seemed interesting to me but it wasn't enough for me to justify buying the game. I also remember thinking that the story had a bit too much teenage edge for me to take seriously. In my write up for Episode 1 I said that it was dificult for me to get an idea of how my actions would affect the story. Episode 2 really showed off how your actions could influence events in other episodes. Seeing how Jons decisions in the first episode impacted the second episode gave me a better idea of how much power we had over the story. That said, the element of Episode 2 that changed my opinion on the story was how Dontnod chose to develop their characters.<br/></p>
<p>I adore games that have a good story mode, but far too many of the games I've played have had villans that are one dimensional. That is to say, they're evil for the sake of being evil. Life is Strange is one of the first games I've come across that really fleshes out their characters, good and bad. David Madsen is a really good example of this. In Episode 1, the only events we can base our opinion of him on, are the scene in the hallway after Max trips the fire alarm, the scene in where we find him yelling at Kate for some reason, and the scene in Chloe's room, where, if you choose to stay hidden, he ends up slapping Chloe. After Episode 1 we have absolutely no reason to sympathize with David and we have no evidene to support the idea that his actions are justified. Episode 2 changes this.<br/></p>
<p>In the hallway scene right before the photography class, Max can talk to Madsen and he ends up having a decent conversation with Max. He says a bit about caring about Chloe despite what Max may think, wanting to find out what happens to missing students and he ends the conversation with something along the lines of, "I don't want to fight with you anymore, I don't want to fight with anyone anymore." This conversation adds so much depth to David completely changed my opinion his character. At the very least this conversation shows us that he has good intentions but he doesn't know how to go about carrying them out. He is harsh, but that's a product of his military background, and althought that may not justify his actions, we can begin to get a better understanding of why he acts the way he does. <br/></p>
<p>We also see minor characters get a bit of depth added to them as well. Early on in the episode, Taylor and Max can have a conversation that leads to Max finding out that Taylors mom is in the Hospital and Victoria was someone who comforted Taylor when she needed it. In addition to getting some backround information on Taylor, this conversation also tells us that Victoria isn't just some bully that lesser minds rally behind, rather she is a good friend to those that she chooses to bring close to her. She may be a bully, but she isn't like that all the time. Mark Jefferson also has a few moments where the game seems to be saying "don't think you've got this guy down completely." In the hallway scene right before you enter his class, he says some things about Kate  that make you question his character. Like how maybe she brought her situation upon herself. It isn't enough to completely change Max's opinion on him but it does come off a bit strange for someone that seems to be a very straight shooter.<br/></p>
<p>Now, I can't talk about Episode 2 without bringing up its incredible ending. If there were any doubts in my mind about whether or not I really wanted this game, seeing this scene removed them. Up until this point I thought the game might just have some messages about bullying, making friends in a new place, and other teenage problems, but then you're brought up to the roof. You see kate standing at the edge and the game basically says, "Okay, I hope you've been paying attention, because it's time to see if you can save this persons life. You've got one shot, bitch." Earlier I said I was watching Jon's playthorugh before I got the game myself. In his playthought, Jon is actually unable to save Kate and she ends up jumping. Even just watching I remember being able to feel some of the emotion that Jon was going through, and then to ultimately end up failing is heartbreaking. When I played through the episode for the first time myself I could feel my heart pounding. The scene builds up such an overwhelming feeling of stress and urgency. I remember taking my time with each decision and each time just hoping I don't make a mistake because this character's life is on the line. This is probably one of the most emotional scenes I've ever seen in a video game.<br/></p>
<p>Life is Strange is a game that I had to let myself enjoy. It deals with emotions of extreme sadness, shock, uncertainty and awkwardness.  As a young guy it's easy for me to want to just write it off as some game that's for angsty girls because I'm a guy and I don't want to talk about emotions and drama. At the same time, it's that exact quality that makes me love the game so much. It's a welcome change of pace from the gorey shooters I normally play. As much as I love my Grand Theft Auto, I don't think I'll see characters as deep as there are in Life is Strange. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, it's all different than what I'm used to, and its so refreshing to see.</p>
