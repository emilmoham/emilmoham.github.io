<h4>Life is Strange: Episode 3</h4>
<h5>October 4th, 2015</h5><br/>
<p>If my high school English classes are to be believed, then the episodes are following a pattern similar to that of a Shakespearean play. Five episodes, each corresponding to one of five acts. Episode 1 was the introduction, showing us all the characters and getting us involved in the story and universe. Episode 2 would then be the rising action, where problems are introduced and we learn about the struggles our character is facing. Episode 3 would then be the complication of the problems.<br/></p>
<p>After my first playthrough of the Episode I remember being somewhat disappointed. It felt like a bunch of setup without any real pay off. After playing through it again, my attitude towards the episode has improved somewhat. Episode 3 is in such an unfortunate spot in this series because it has to live up to the standards that Episode 2 set. I was expecting Episode 3 to top what Episode 2 did, but that never happened and that left me feeling let down the first time around. Episode 3 does not live up to the standards Dontnod set in Episode 2 but that isn't a bad thing. If each episode had to top the one that came before it, the episodes would end up losing the elements of relatability and pacing that give them their charm. Think about what has become of the Fast and Furious movies. They started out as decent racing movies but after the fourth, they had to keep upping the ante. The writers of the movies probably found themselves writing themselves into a corner. They go from street racing to taking down drug cartels to jumping cars out of planes. Instead of falling into the trap of upping the ante and writing themselves into a corner, Dontnod kept the episode interesting by hitting you with difficult choices to setup future episodes and further establishing the backstory.<br/></p>
<p>Depending on one's playthough there are five major choices in Episode 3. The hardest choice by far, for me, was the choice between siding with Chloe or siding with David. I agonized over this choice quite a bit and no matter what I choose I can't seem to walk away from it feeling like I made the right decision. Up until this point I've been making my decisions on the basis that I'm choosing the option that makes the most sense from Max's point of view. For example, when it came to Warren asking Max to "Go Ape" with him, I decide against going with Warren, even though I would have said yes if I were Max simply because she writes several times in her journal that she sees warren as a friend and nothing more. If you do choose to accept, she writes in her journal something along the lines of, "I hope warren doesn't try one of his lame moves on me at the movie." Or something like that. When it came to choosing between whether or not to shoot Frank, it made more sense to me that Max would be the type of person who couldn't shoot someone. You could make the argument that both options for that particular choice end up with Max not shooting Frank, but I just couldn't see Max pulling the trigger so I went with the other choice.<br/></p>
<p>So, back to siding with David or Chloe. I chose to side with David this time around, and to be honest, I just can't justify it. No matter how I look at it, it just doesn't make sense from Max's Point of view. I've tried thinking about how the Price's are in debt and they need both David and Joyce in the house to keep afloat. I've tried thinking about how David is well intentioned even though his actions seem a bit harsh at times. I've tried thinking about how it may benefit Chloe and Max to have David on their side in future episodes, but it just doesn't make sense to side with David. This is especially true when I consider how Max justifies it in the game. She says something along the lines of "We don't have any proof that David did anything to anyone." After looking at the files on the computer it's hard to argue with the idea that David really is just a paranoid ex-soldier. I really do believe that David is a good person, he just jumps to conclusions far too quickly and that ultimately leads to his downfall as a character. His files on Kate specifically make this clear. Everything she does, is followed up with an assumption that she is bringing drugs onto the campus or something like that.<br/></p>
<p>No other choice in this game has had me so divided and unsure of what to do. With every other choice, I've been able to find some justification for either side, but not this one. Even now I'm considering if I want to go back and change it one last time and side with Chloe before Episode 5 releases. I have no Idea what I want to do. I'll let you know what I do in my write up for the next episode. Whatever is in that write up will be the final choices I make before going into Episode 5. See you then.<br/></p>
