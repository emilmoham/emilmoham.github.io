<h4>Life is Strange: Episode 4</h4>
<h5>October 18th, 2015</h5><br/>
<p>I've spared no time procrastinating composing this write up. Two days remain before the release of Episode 5 and I'm excited. Since my last write up, I did end up going back and changing a few of my choices to line up better with what I thought fit Max's character the best. This included saying no to Warren's drive in date, as well as siding with Chloe over Madsen in Episode 3.</br></p>
<p>There was so much hype surrounding the release of this episode when it first came out. Way more than I honestly thought it could deliver on, but then it came out, and lived up to all of my expectations and then some. The writing in this episode is phenomenal. I love the way this episode expressed so many different emotions.<br/></p>
<p>It starts of with an intensely heavy opening. Every second I spent with alternative Chloe made me feel like such a dick for putting her and her family through that type of pain and stress. Walking around talking to William and seeing all the things that the Price family has to deal with is honestly heartbreaking. It's a subject that I imagine a fair few people can relate to including myself. All of the documents showing how the Price family was in debt and how Chloe's condition was only getting hit pretty close to home. At the time the episode came out, my Mom was in a similar situation with my grandmother who had Alzheimers. We weren't being buried under debt, thankfully, but my Mom had to make a great deal of sacrifices to be able to take care of my grandmother while also working. Medications, doctors appointments, waking up at five to feed and clothe her in the morning, and then coming home at night and cleaning, and feeding her again. Similar to Joyce and William, my Mom had to give up almost all her free time to take care of my grandmother. From the time she woke up to the time she went to sleep my Mom would be working or taking care of my grandmother. There was no possibility of outside help as we couldn't afford it. While we weren't struggling nearly as bad as the Price family in the game, our situation made the scene all the more powerful for me.<br/></p>
<p>Then the scene ends with Chloe asking Max to euthanize her. I gave this decision quite a bit of thought, and came to the conclusion that it was more humane to kill Chloe. I didn't feel good about doing it, and in real life I'm not sure I would have the strength to carry out a request like that, but I honestly think it's the right thing to do.  I mentioned back in my write up for Episode 1 that I was playing this game along side two of my friends. This is the choice that had us the most divided. It's a tough choice to make, and honestly feels like there isn't a positive outcome no matter which side you choose, but it's choices like these that make this game great and memorable. This was just the first branching point of the Episode too! I knew at this point that this episode was going to be something amazing.<br/></p>
<p>From there it was nice to get some closure on Kate's story. The next scene worth analyzing is the scene in the Boy's dormitories. Yet again, the writers found a way to complicate Nathan's character. They showed that he wasn't crazy for the sake of being crazy, but instead he had legitimate family issues with his father. The reason I love this scene so much however is because of what happens when Nathan finds Max and Chloe in his dorm. In my first playthrough, I didn't even think about letting Warren keep going on Nathan. I didn't even watch the outcome of that decision. I saw later in another playthrough what happened if you let that happen. It was honestly hard to watch the first time around. What's worse is that I honestly think it may be the better outcome, and I can't bring myself to let it happen. If Nathan is beaten, he may be less of a problem later on in the story, but this is another one of those cases where I just don't see it fitting Max's character. I feel like Max wouldn't want Warren to beat someone to the point of begging. Ultimately I chose to stop Warren.<br/></p>
<p>Next came the detective work. I absolutely loved sifting through all the clues trying to find the ones that led us to Rachael. The one that gave me the most trouble was the phone. I didn't realize that you could enter the PUK to unlock it and ended up trying for 30 minutes to crack it. I did eventually get it but it was after trying every combination of on the papers two or three times. Eventually I just said "fuck it" and tried the birthday. I felt like a genius when I got it and I was so happy when I saw that only ~20% of people figured out the code on the first day. Searching the Barn and Dark Room felt tense. The entire time I felt like Max and Chloe were going to be found but it never happened. It was nice that they added back story to the Prescott family in the barn as well. I was surprised at the reveal of Rachael Amber's death in this episode, but only because it was this episode and not Episode 5. It felt like something that should have been revealed at the end. The actual reveal was incredibly sad. Chloe's voice actress really sold the emotion in that scene incredibly well. A part of me wanted to believe that Rachael was alive somewhere but I'm perfectly satisfied with this outcome as well. <br/></p>
<p>The party was a bit weird. I'm not sure why Max decided that it was the right time to go around giving everyone a pep talk, but whatever I'll roll with it. I liked the conversation with Victoria, because they didn't force Max and Victoria to be friends out of nowhere. Instead they found a much more natural way to make Victoria choose to listen or ignore Max based on her previous actions which was a nice pay off for the player. So now we reach the end. Max and Chloe go to Rachael's grave and BOOM! Max is drugged, Chloe is shot, and who else is behind it except for Natha...MISTER JEFFERSON?! What? To be honest this is a twist that I saw coming from Episode 2 after he all the things he said about Kate. Unfortunately even though I saw it coming, I still wanted to be wrong about that prediction. I just wanted him to be a straight shooter. Expecting it to happened did not soften the blow whatsoever in this case.</br></p>
<p>Now it's time for Episode 5, and I'm honestly unsure of what I want out of this game. I would love to see the game end with a really difficult moral choice that leaves me feeling terrible about myself no matter what I choose, but I honestly feel like I'm not going to get it. I know for certain that Chloe will come back and meet Max at the light house during the storm. We saw it in Episode 1 during the last nightmare before Max snaps back to reality. Any type of sad ending would honestly make me feel satisfied. I'd be really disappointed if it turns out to be some fairytale ending. We'll see tomorrow!</br></p>
