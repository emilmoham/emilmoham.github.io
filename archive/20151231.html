<h4>The Losing Side of History</h4>
<h5>December 31, 2015 - Latest Entry</h5>
<br/>
<p>Towards the end of this year I've started to notice a common theme games and movies I've been playing and watching. The major
    pieces that I saw connections between were SOMA, Fallout 4, Blade Runner, and Ex Machina. Each of these has a story that
    deals with artificial intelligence to some degree.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>For SOMA we are taken to a world where Robots are given human consciences and this eventually leads to us answering tough
    questions about whether a copied human conscience can still be sentient. If our conscience was some how copied to another
    body, are we still the same person? If our conscience remained in the original body which body is the true us?
    <br/>
</p>
<p>Fallout 4, even though I haven't completed the main story yet, has dispute between the Railroad and the Institute. Should
    an AI, if it is advanced enough to think and want to be free of its captivity be given the opportunity to do so? If an
    AI ever gets advanced enough to be indistinguishable from a human, would it be deserving of the same rights humans are
    granted?
    <br/>
</p>
<p>Blade Runner has the Replicants who were made to do the work that was deemed too dangerous for Humans to do on other planets.
    Much like the institute, the Tyrell Corporation created the Replicants to be slaves to humans, but when they achieve
    sentience and begin to defy the humans the moral question of whether AI's deserve rights rises again.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>Ex Machina was the most recent film I watched that depicted this question again. Is it morally right to create an AI that
    is capable of free thinking and feeling complicated emotions purely with the intent to be used as a slave.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>These stories all ask questions that boil down to something close to "Do robots with advanced AI's deserve freedom?" In my
    opinion the answer to this question is no. Something about being created from machinery and code strips the right to
    freedom away from robots for me. The biggest problem I have with it is that I don't quite know where to draw the line
    when it comes to robots. I think Fallout 4's Virgil summed it up best when he gave his thoughts on the Railroad, saying
    something along the lines of "...I thought they'd be too busy trying to liberate vending machines..." At what point would
    an AI be considered sentient enough to deserve rights and freedom?
    <br/>
</p>
<p>What I find interesting about this position is that I think it's one of the few points for which I feel I'm on the losing
    side of history. The losing side of history is a phrase I first heard in a Vlogbrothers video. Link if I can find it.
    As I sit here I'm wondering if someday generations after me will look at this issue the same way I look at the issues
    of Gay rights today. As time goes forward it's inevitable that future generations will just be more accepting and open
    to these ideas than I ever will be.
