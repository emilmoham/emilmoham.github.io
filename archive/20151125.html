<h4>On Nostalgia</h4>
<h5>November 25th, 2015</h5>
<br/>
<p>It's been nearly a month since my last entry and at the very least I don't want to leave November without having at least
    one entry on the site. I've been playing a fair bit of Fallout 4 and although I'm enjoying it I feel like I'm also frustrated
    with it at the same time. I'm playing the game on the hardest difficulty with a rather squishy character build, while
    avoiding taking along companions if I can help it. Basically what I'm saying is that I'm dying left and right and this
    game is bullshit, but I'll do another blog about Fallout some time in the near future. Instead of focusing on the game
    itself, I want to talk a bit about that feeling of frustration that I mentioned earlier. That frustration is familiar
    to me. It's a feeling that I get whenever I start to learn a new game because, despite how much of an avid gamer I am,
    I still suck at most games when I first try them out. It's only after I've sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into a
    game that I begin to gain some skill and that feeling of frustration goes away. Unfortunately it's then replaced by a
    feeling of sadness that I'll never be in the same position to learn the game again.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>There's something exciting about learning a game for the first time that I always hate at first but realize later that I
    actually loved. Anarchy Online is one of the best examples I can think of right now. I remember just running around that
    game talking to every NPC that I could looking for quests I could do. I didn't know anything about the game at the time,
    I had barely left the starting island I certainly wasn't equipped to fight anything outside of the first area on the
    mainland. I couldn't use the main method of transportation in the game, "The Grid", and the quests I ended up doing,
    weren't even that good in terms of experience or reward. The reason I probably ended up sticking to that path however
    was probably because I so bad at the combat in that game. At the time, I really hated grinding and quests were the way
    to escape that in MMO's. Fighting hundreds of monsters to get a few levels just wasn't that interesting to me and I found
    it frustrating. At the same time I eventually learned that the quests sucked too and that frustrated me as well. If I
    didn't have friends that also played the game I probably wouldn't have stuck with it at all. I played with them and we
    ended up learning and improving at the game together.
    <br/>

<p>Fast forward about four years and I find that I'm a bit sick of the game so I decide to quit for a while. A few more years
    pass and I decide to go back just to see how much things have changed. There was definitely new content for me to play
    through but learning it just wasn't as fun as learning the game the first time because I was so well established by that
    point that I didn't have the same sense of excitement. Any equipment that came with the new content was easy enough to
    get because it all followed the same logic as the rest of the game and while I understand it's not really possible to
    change combat mechanics in an MMO, it just serves to make the new content feel stale and samey after a short period of
    time. All my money making methods were still viable and in some cases even better than when I had left off. Friends and
    Clan mates that had played the game with me before had long since quit and the population was dwindling all over. I missed
    the days when I began playing back in 2005 where it seemed like anything was possible in the game and there was constantly
    something new to do. Maybe that's what I'm missing when I feel nostalgic about games. I miss being able to drop everything
    and just walk in a random direction for 20 minutes and find something new and interesting. It's hard to get bored when
    you're constantly increasing your options for content. It's only after you've had a ton of time to spend discovering
    new things that you eventually run out of things to discover and then further down the line when you've tried everything
    at least once it's only natural that you begin to feel bored.

<p>I certainly don't feel this way about every game I don't miss the old days of Runescape because I never really accomplished
    anything when I played that game back in 2003. Or maybe it's because Old School Runescape is a thing now and I can go
    back and play it whenever I want, but even then when I picked up 07scape with some friends I met in college, I was able
    to discover all content pretty much for the first time. It's fair to say that I haven't sunk as much time into 07scape
    as I have Anarchy Online and maybe I'm just going to hit that wall sometime in the future. At least in Runescape I haven't
    even hit the end game content yet and I probably wont for a long time.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>I think what I need to take from this is that I need to enjoy the blissful ignorance that comes with learning a game for
    the first time. You can't learn a game twice so enjoy that feeling of endless possibility. When I die 10 times in a row,
    or get stuck on some problem in a game, maybe I should take a step back and realize that these are the moments that I'll
    end up remembering with fondness because of how bad I was when I passed them. They serve as a point to measure progress
    and make the game worth playing. Without that feeling of frustration to overcome, the game probably wouldn't be worth
    playing.
