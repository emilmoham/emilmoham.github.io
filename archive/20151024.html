<h4>Life is Strange: Episode 5</h4>
<h5>October 24, 2015</h5>
<br/>
<p>I've been letting my thoughts about this episode settle for a few days now. If I had composed this write up immediately after
    finishing the episode on Monday, I probably wouldn't have had anything good to say about it, but the more I think about
    it, the more praise I have for this episode. I think right now I'm in a good mental state where I can write up this review
    without being too harsh. I'm not going to lie, I still feel really disappointed with how things turned out, but honestly
    it is a worthy episode of being called the end of Life is Strange. I'm not going to put Dontnod on "Literal Hitler" status
    for this episode, though others may disagree with me.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>I suppose I may as well start from the beginning. The scene in the Dark Room was done pretty well. I felt uneasy and anxious
    the entire time I was there. I found myself looking around the room franticly trying to find the correct highlightable
    object to interact with, because I didn't want to find out if Jefferson came back into the room after a set amount of
    time or not. The sequence of events that Max used get to a point where she could escape the Dark Room was confusing but
    made scene from Max's point of view. Max was constantly using whatever photograph she came across first to try and manipulate
    the events of the past to free herself in the future. It all makes sense in an "I'm desperate to get out of here" kind
    of way. The only small problem I really have with the Dark Room scenes is how they portray Jefferson's character. He
    comes off as a bit over exaggerated with how evil he is in this episode. A character I did like, however, was David,
    who finally got his hero moment in the story. I had been predicting since episode 2 that Dontnod would try to spin him
    on us and make him a hero. I really liked how they chose to show how much he cared about Chloe when Max told him what
    happened to her. As sad as it was to see how much he was affected by her death, it showed a lot of development for his
    character. I chose to go through with telling him the truth and seeing him standing over Jefferson's corpse wondering
    how he was going to face Joyce made me sympathize with him pretty much for the first time in the series.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>So Max eventually makes it out and she's drives over to meet Warren. The message Nathan left her made me feel kind of sorry
    for him but at the same time he was drugging and taking advantage of girls on a regular basis so we can't really be expected
    to see him as a victim in all of this. It's shown in previous episodes that he has mental issues due to his family situation
    especially with his Dad, but at some point I feel like he has to be held responsible for his actions, regardless of what
    may have drove him to them. The scene leading up to the diner gave us a bit of closure on some minor characters which
    was kind of nice. I did miss a few of the characters, including Alyssa so in my playthough Max didn't help her when she
    needed it most. I accidentally killed the fisherman like three times. I didn't think to rewind in the room he was in
    and eventually just left him there alive to die a fiery death. I'd like to think he died of smoke inhalation instead
    of being burned alive. Inside the diner, I chose to hug Warren, I've always liked the guy, even if Max didn't. I felt
    like a friendly hug seemed appropriate and justifiable from Max's point of view where Warren is just a friend.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>The next scene worth writing about is the Nightmare sequence. This scene was a lot of fun to play through, but I'm not really
    sure what it added to the story. If I had to guess, I'd say that it was there to point out just how bad Max had affected
    time with all of her rewinds. The part of this scene that stuck with me the most was talking to the alternate Max in
    the diner. The alternate Max brought up the argument that Max had been using her power purely for selfish reasons, either
    making friends or impressing people who would otherwise had payed no attention to her. This was fairly true about Max,
    especially in the first two episodes and to an extent the third. Episode 4 saw Max putting herself second only to Chloe.
    Look at the first part of Episode 4 in the alternate reality. Max in that universe is popular, she seems to have more
    money, and she's more confident in her work. When Max makes the decision to go back to their first universe, she doesn't
    even consider the fact that things may be worse for herself in the original universe, the only person she cares about
    is Chloe. Similarly in Episode 5 when Max wins the Everyday Heroes contest, the only thing she cares about when she's
    in the gallery is making sure she doesn't lose Chloe. It never crossed her mind that she could be more successful in
    that universe. This is where the alternate Max begins to lose me, because she says that Chloe is just using Max and that
    Chloe is a bad friend to Max. I don't agree with this, Chloe upon learning how much Max has tried to do for her shows
    sincere gratitude towards Max. Max and Chloe are friends because they make eachother feel safe and happy mutually. It
    is a benefit that Max happens to have rewind powers not a pillar of their friendship.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>So eventually we end up by the lighthouse with Chloe and Max begins to spill her emotions about the storm. Max realizes that
    the storm is her creation and through her time travel powers, she has messed up the order of the universe. Every time
    she saves Chloe specifically, the storm gets worse. So Chloe, also realizing that this is the case, pulls out the butterfly
    photograph that Max took on day one, the idea being that if Max goes back and lets Chloe die, the storm will never have
    to happen. People have been predicting that this was the case since way back in Episode 2, and while I could understand
    the logic behind the theory, I never really bought it. The way I saw it, the storm didn't really seem to be linked to
    Chloe. We start the game seeing it hit the bay before we even know who Chloe is. We save her in the bathroom and then
    nothing is shown to us. In Episode 2 it was possible for Chloe to shoot herself, but assuming the player just doesn't
    make the wrong decision, Max would never know about this and Chloe never has to get injured. Later on in that same episode,
    Chloe's life is again put in danger when she gets stuck on the tracks. I don't see that as the universe needing to kill
    Chloe because assuming the player knows what to do, Max can save Chloe from that situation without ever having to rewind
    in that case. You could make the argument that saving her from the train so quickly is really only likely if the player
    has played the scene before but I still think that it's possible and therefore Chloe doesn't necessarily have to die
    in that scene. I suppose it begins to make more sense in Episode 4 with the alternate universe. There, even though Chloe
    was in the accident, we still see signs of the storm coming with all the dead animals around. But the biggest argument
    I have against this theory is in Episode 5 itself. When David saves Max in the bunker, the storm can clearly be heard,
    despite Chloe being dead. If Chloe is really the cause of the storm then why does it still hit Arcadia bay when she dies?
    I suppose this could be explained by the idea that her death was too late and the Universe had already sent the storm
    but when Chloe dies, the weather is clearly fine and there are no signs of a storm coming. I'm not saying that the choice
    at the end has no legitimate evidence behind it, I was just hoping that Dontnod could find a more solid reason for the
    storm and that they would base our final choice around that instead.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>So that's one of the problems I have with the ending. The other Problem I have is that our choices throughout the game seem
    to have no effect on the ending of the game. I'm somewhat ashamed to admit this, but I originally chose the save Chloe
    ending, partly because I thought I might be able to rewind after it all and partly because I wanted all the decisions
    I made to have some impact on what would happen after I was done playing. I now know that the save Chloe ending is shit.
    All we see is Max and Chloe driving through all the wreckage and leaving Arcadia bay with Max, understandably, looking
    like she'll never come to peace with the fact that she condemned everyone in the town to die. I guess I thought that
    after all we went through to try and save Chloe, all the disagreements, all the emotions, all the hoops we had to jump
    through to bring her back from the dead after Episode 4, I wanted to think that maybe we could find a way to make it
    all work. I wanted to believe that we could be with Chloe and things might somehow be okay. I certainly didn't think
    it was the morally right thing to do. There's obviously no way to justify, at least from a moral point of view, saving
    just Chloe's life over the lives of everyone in the town. Honestly there's nothing good about this ending, so I went
    back to that scene and chose the other side. The sacrifice Chloe option is far more satisfying and I thought what it
    did show was really well done. Seeing Max just fall to the floor in the bathroom and jolt as the shot is heard only to
    start silently crying broke my heart. The music was beautiful and fit the emotion of the scene incredibly well. Despite
    all of this, I still felt like I had thrown away everything that had happened in the first four episodes. While some
    choices had already shown what their consequences were before the ending, I still felt like some of the things I was
    promised would have an effect on future events, either didn't show up in the end, or didn't have any effect outside of
    changing a line of dialogue or two. Ultimately I left feeling like I didn't have as much control over the events of the
    game as I had originally thought.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>In my write up for Episode 4, I asked for and ending where I couldn't feel good about myself no matter what I chose. In a
    way, this episode delivers upon that and I can respect it because that final choice was pretty much what I asked for.
    I didn't feel good about sacrificing everyone else for Chloe. I didn't feel good about sacrificing Chloe for Arcadia
    Bay because her death is so sad. I wish the choice had been a bit less black and white for me though. If I had known
    that there would be no confirmation of choice at the end like every other choice in the game, then I probably would have
    saved Arcadia Bay the first time around. There simply isn't a way to justify letting the entire city get wiped out for
    Chloe. Even if you can somehow justify it, it seems that Dontnod put all the development time into the ending for Chloe's
    death and kind of just let Max and Chloe drive off into the sunset for the other ending. A lot of people have been talking
    about what they think the lesson was and the one idea I haven't seen raised was the one that was originally introduced
    to us by the homeless woman. In episode 3, you can talk to her behind the diner and if you go down the right path, she
    says that you can't save everybody. I think that statement sums up the final decision pretty well. We can either save
    Chloe and screw over the town or Save the town and let Chloe die. No matter what you do, someone has to pay for that
    choice.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>So here I am, at the end of the game, feeling sad to see it come to an end. Episode 5 may not have been everything I was
    hoping for but it'd be extremely unfair to say that it wasn't an appropriate ending. While I was hoping that we would
    learn more about the Prescotts, see more of of our choices pay off, and ultimately have a more dynamic ending, the episode
    still did what it needed to do to reach a decent conclusion. The ending may have lost me a bit but at least there was
    one choice where I felt legitimately sad for what I had to do to make things right. Overall I'm happy to have stumbled
    upon this game and shared it with a few of my friends. I'll be interested to see what they say when they play through
    it. Life is Strange has been such a wonderful game to play through. It had some amazing characters, an absorbing atmosphere,
    and a story, that although could have ended better, played on my emotions like piano and kept me interested for the better
    part of a year. I'm happy to have had this experience.
