<h4>Life is Strange: Episode 1</h4>
<h5>September 14th, 2015</h5>
<br/>
<p>With the release of Episode 5 for Life Is Strange being right around the corner, I want to take the time to gather my thoughts
    on the story as well as the game as a whole so far. I've decided to play through the episodes one by one(yet again),
    and write down my thoughts on each one as I go through them. Let's do this.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>As much as I love this game, Episode 1 is by far the most boring in the series. I don't think it's a bad episode, I just
    find that the episode as a whole is incredibly slow paced. I guess it had to be this way because the episode is tasked
    with explaining the core mechanics of the game as well as most of the characters and locations we will be visiting over
    the next four episodes. Since it's the first episode it make sense that we wouldn't be making any massive decisions as
    the developers probably wanted to give us more time to explore the game's universe before throwing us all the way in.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>I've shown this game to a two of my friends and when I was trying to sell the game's story to them I felt I had to tell them
    that this is the first episode and that the game really doesn't pick up until very near the end of it. The game seems
    to spend a lot of the episode screaming at you that Rachael Amber is missing and that her disappearance has had a sizable
    impact on the school. The scene in the courtyard specifically comes to mind. Every single person you can talk to, with
    the exception of Brooke and Mrs. Grant, if I recall correctly, has something to say about how they were great friends
    with Rachael and how weird it is that she went missing. By the time I've heard about it from Daniel, Stella, Evan, Justin,
    and Hayden, I've begun to understand that she's a big deal. It begins to get repetitive and slow. This game does this
    several times in multiple episodes in fact, but I'll get to that another day.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>As much as I truly enjoyed looking at every poster, and talking to every person that would listen to me, the truth is, the
    first time I really felt any reason to stick with the game was when Max hid in Chloe's closet and had to choose between
    intervening Chloe and David or staying hidden. Up until this point all of the major decisions seemed to have a "good"
    outcome and a "bad" outcome. When it came to reporting Nathan, the choice was between telling the principle the truth
    and having him do nothing about it, or keeping your mouth shut and having the principle think you were being dishonest
    anyway. In the case of stepping in to help Kate, we had to choose between taking a picture and upsetting Kate further
    or stepping in and seeing her happy for the first time in that episode. Until the scene where Max hides in Chloe's closet,
    it's a bit hard to see how your choices will effect the game. You could argue that it's a bit short sighted to make decisions
    like that in this style of game, but for someone like me, who hasn't played any game like this before, it's a bit harder
    for me to get into.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>All of that said, there's a lot to like about Episode 1. The constant repetition and relatively slow pace of the first episode
    is the only real complaints I have with the story. I really did enjoy spending hours looking at every highlightable object
    trying to get Max's thoughts on everything I could. I enjoyed hunting for all the photos and getting immersed in the
    beautiful world the game is set in. I enjoyed meeting all the characters and abusing the time reversal mechanic to make
    sure I heard as many different outcomes for each conversation that I could. I certainly enjoyed listening to the phenomenal
    music selection the game has.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>As I'm writing this I'm realizing that it's getting really late. I want to get into my thoughts on the controls of the game,
    and art style and things of that nature but it will have to wait until I'm done with episode 2.</p>
